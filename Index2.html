            <h1>Do you feel proud of your work?</h1>
            <p>Yes, I am definitely proud of my work, no matter it is simple or complex. Whenever I see that the game I created with Unity finally runs smoothly, or the radio I welded finally makes a sound, the satisfaction at that moment is real. Creating these works allows me to see my thinking ability and creativity when facing complex problems, and feel the sense of accomplishment of turning ideas into reality through technology.</p>

        <section class="question">
            <h1>What makes you most excited to create? Or does it give you tremendous anxiety? Or both?</h1>
            <p>My desire to explore is the biggest driving force in my creative process. I like the process of starting from scratch, from an abstract idea to becoming concrete and interactive through code or circuits. My results are always very different from my initial ideas. This is my decoding and reconstruction of the digital world. Especially when a problem that has been bothering me is finally solved, the excitement of breaking through the bottleneck makes me feel that all the efforts are worth it. Of course, this will also bring tremendous pressure. Especially when errors occur during code or hardware debugging, and I don’t know where the problem is, the feeling of powerlessness is very strong. In the process of continuous attempts and adjustments, this anxiety will always accompany me. I think this is very natural in the creative process, because the more anxious you are when solving a problem, the more excited you will be after solving it.</p>

        <section class="question">
            <h1>How do you feel when you finish a work? When you don’t finish a work?</h1>
            <p>Due to the ductility of my medium, I think my work has only two states: unstarted and unfinished. Temporary pause only means that my ability is not enough for me to show better results now, but it does not mean that I can’t do it in the future. They will not be forgotten, but stored in my inspiration library. Maybe at some point in the future, I will return to these unfinished works and find new directions and motivation to continue to complete them.</p>

        <section class="question">
            <h1>Do you have any personal philosophies you follow in your creative practice?</h1>
            <p>The philosophy I have always followed is to maintain the desire to explore and refuse to compromise. Exploration means that I will constantly look for new methods and tools to solve problems encountered or to realize those seemingly difficult ideas. I think compromise is a waste of inspiration. I accept the twists and turns and setbacks in the creative process, but I will never give up my inspiration easily.</p>
